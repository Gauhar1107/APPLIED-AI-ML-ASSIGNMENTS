    "The Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from Amazon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of reviews: 568,454\n",
    "Number of users: 256,059\n",
    "Number of products: 74,258\n",
    "Timespan: Oct 1999 - Oct 2012\n",
    "Number of Attributes/Columns in data: 10\n",
    "\n",
    "Attribute Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 Id\n",
    "\n",
    "2 ProductId - unique identifier for the product\n",
    "\n",
    "3 UserId - unqiue identifier for the user\n",

    "4 ProfileName\n",
    "\n",
    "5 HelpfulnessNumerator - number of users who found the review helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "6 HelpfulnessDenominator - number of users who indicated whether they found the review helpful or not\n",
    "\n",
    "7 Score - rating between 1 and 5\n",
    "\n",
    "8 Time - timestamp for the review\n",

    "9 Summary - brief summary of the review\n",

    "Objective:\n",
    "Given a review, determine whether the review is positive (rating of 4 or 5) or negative (rating of 1 or 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "[Q] How to determine if a review is positive or negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Ans] We could use Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 can be cosnidered as a positive review. A rating of 1 or 2 can be considered as negative one. A review of rating 3 is considered nuetral and such reviews are ignored from our analysis. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) of a review.\n",

    "The dataset is available in two forms\n",

    "SQLite Database\n",
    "In order to load the data, We have used the SQLITE dataset as it is easier to query the data and visualise the data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here as we only want to get the global sentiment of the recommendations (positive or negative), we will purposefully ignore all Scores equal to 3. If the score is above 3, then the recommendation wil be set to \"positive\". Otherwise, it will be set to \"negative\"."
